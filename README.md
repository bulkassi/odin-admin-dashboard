# odin-admin-dashboard

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It involved creating a stylized webpage based on the given [template](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png). The primary focus of this assignment is to incorporate the heavy usage of Grid to create layout for sidebar, header and dashboard. However, Flexbox was also used for less complex layouts (like header rows and sidebar options). As a result, the following topics were revised and made use of: Grid creation, Grid positioning, Grid properties (`repeat`, `fr` for dynamic sizing and others).

All SVGs were downloaded from [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/), while all used images of Pusheen are not mine and belong to their respective owners.
